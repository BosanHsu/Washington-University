Given that the toy corpus is so small, we know all \"topics\" it contains (**what are they?**) and it will be easy for us:<br> 1) to check if the topic model results make sense; <br>2) see all the results that the topic model produces.  <br><br>\n",
        "We will be using the **LatentDirichletAllocation** function which we already imported earlier (see Session Prep). The function has the following **parameters** to be set:\n",
        "1. Number of topics to model: **n_components**\n",

        "Notes on **parameter vectors for the Dirichlet distributions**: <br>\n",
        "1. Although the Dirichlet distribution parameters are represented by a **vector**, for simplicity we provide one number for each parameter vector. For example, if we set the number of topics to 2 (n_components=2), the parameter vector for the Dirichlet distribution for *topics* should be a two-dimensional vector. We set doc_topic_prior=0.5 and the LatentDirichletAllocation function internally creates a two-dimensional vector (0.5,0.5). Similar logic applies to the parameter vector for the Dirichlet distribution for *words* (the dimensionality of that parameter vector is equal to the number of terms in the text corpus, which is typically very large).<br><br>\n",
        "2. Remember, that we need **sparsity** in the distribution of topics across documents (i.e., some documents have a zero probability of containing some of the topics) and *sparsity* in the distribution of words in topics (i.e., some words have zero probability to be present in some topics). To induce sparsity, we need to set **doc_topic_prior** and **topic_word_prior** between 0 and 1.\n",

You can also find that you might get a slightly different result (for the estimated weights) if you rerun the model (qualitatively, the result is likely to stay the same). This behavior is due to the stochastic nature of the model. Estimation starts from a random guess for the weights and iteratively improves. When we do not allow for a large number of iterations, we are more likely to be affected by the random starting values."
